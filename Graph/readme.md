## C++ Graph Library

This library consists of *.h and *.cpp files, most-importantly: Graph.h and Graph.cpp. Including these files will allow the user to instantiate 'Graph' objects to model graph-related problems. Graphs are persistent (ie they can be written to disk as *.txt files for later retrieval through a read-from-file Graph constructor). 

No external libraries (eg Boost) were used in this project, except for the C++ Standard Template Library.

## Use Example
```c++
#include Graph.h
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    //Declare a Graph object, populate it.	
    Graph G;
    G.addNode("A"); 
    G.addNode("B");
    G.addEdge("A","B");
    ...
    vector<string> shortestPath = G.BFS("A","Z");
    Graph MST = G.Prims(); //Creates new Graph object from G
    MST.saveGraph("MinimumSpanningTree"); //Write MST to disk

    //Retrieve Graph object from .txt file
    Graph F(string("NetworkConnections.txt"));
}
```



## Installation

Simply download the .h and .cpp files, place them in your working directory, and "#include" them in your appropiate files.
